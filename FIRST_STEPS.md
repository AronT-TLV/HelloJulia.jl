# Installing Julia

While Julia can be run in the cloud (see e.g.,
[here](https://juliahub.com/ui/Home)) we recommend installing Julia
(which is free) on your machine when starting out:

- *Installing julia compiler:* [Ubuntu](https://ferrolho.github.io/blog/2019-01-26/how-to-install-julia-on-ubuntu) or similar; [Mac, Windows, or other](https://julialang.org/download/)


- Open the downloaded application (or run `julia` from a
  terminal/console) to launch the command-line interface for
  interacting with julia (its called the
  [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop)).

- At the `julia> ` prompt, type the obligatory `println("Hello
  world!")` to check the REPL is alive.
