# Installing Julia

While Julia can be run in the cloud (see e.g.,
[here](https://juliahub.com/ui/Home)) we recommend installing Julia on
your machine when starting out:

- *Install the julia compiler:*
  [Ubuntu](https://ferrolho.github.io/blog/2019-01-26/how-to-install-julia-on-ubuntu)
  or similar; [Mac,
  Windows](https://www.juliafordatascience.com/first-steps-1-installing-julia/). The
  Julia download page is [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

- Open the downloaded application in the usual way for your OS, or run
  `julia` from a terminal/console. This launches a command-line
  interface for interacting with julia called the
  [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop).
  
- At the `julia> ` prompt, type the obligatory `println("Hello
  world!")` to check the REPL is alive and kicking.
